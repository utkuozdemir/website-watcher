Watch websites, get notifications. Simple as that.  
Can be useful for stock tracking.

I built this tool to have full control on the watching logic,
and not be limited with the capabilities of the 3rd party tools 
(like [Huginn](https://github.com/huginn/huginn), 
which I built a [Helm chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/utkuozdemir/huginn) for).
